# Human Flourishing Project Notebook
This is a simple notebook that shows (partial) results of the LLM analysis of the 2.2 billion subset of USA tweets extracted from the global Harvard's [Twitter Geolocated Archive](https://gis.harvard.edu/geotweets-archive-v20). 

Computation is not finished yet.
You can explore partial results (year >= 2012) for some of the 46 flourishing dimensions. We suggest to explore ```happiness`` for the moment.

The analysis was run at Census ID level and aggreagated at County and State level by year.

On the main [data repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/siacus/flourishing) on Huggingface (that will be constantly updated as data are avaiable) you can also find monthly aggregation by  county and state as well.
