# Fine-tuning LLAMA 3.2 3B

This directory will contain the scripts to fine-tune and quantize the models used in this project

Fine-tuning is an external piece of this project, the user can assume that an existing model (either fine-tuned or not) exists and adapt the prompts.

Fine-tuning strategy is based on this paper: [Carammia, M., Iacus, S.M.,  Porro, G. (2024) Rethinking Scale: The Efficacy of Fine-Tuned Open-Source LLMs in Large-Scale Reproducible Social Science Research, ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00890).
